# OpenClaw Dashboard

A beautiful, zero-dependency command center for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) AI agents.

## Why This Exists

When you run OpenClaw seriously — multiple agents, dozens of cron jobs, sub-agents spawning sub-agents, several Telegram groups and Whatsapp, Slack, and Discord channels, 10+ models, multiple agents and sub-agents — information gets scattered fast.

**The problem:** there was no single place to answer the obvious questions:
- Is my gateway actually running right now?
- How much have I spent today, and which model is burning the most?
- Which cron jobs ran, which failed, and when does the next one fire?
- What sessions are active and how much context are they consuming?
- Are my sub-agents doing useful work or spinning in circles?
- What's the cost trend over the last 7 days — am I accelerating?

The only way to answer these was digging through log files, running CLI commands, and mentally stitching together a picture from 5 different sources. That friction adds up.

**The solution:** a single local page that collects everything in one place — gateway health, costs, cron status, active sessions, sub-agent runs, model usage, git log — refreshed automatically, no login, no cloud, no external dependencies. Open a browser tab, get the full picture in seconds.

It's not trying to replace the OpenClaw CLI or Telegram interface. It's the at-a-glance overview layer that tells you whether everything is healthy and where your money and compute are going — so you can make decisions without hunting for data.

### Custom Themes

Add your own themes by editing `themes.json`. Each theme defines 19 CSS color variables:

```json
{
  "my-theme": {
    "name": "My Theme",
    "type": "dark",
    "icon": "🎯",
    "colors": {
      "bg": "#1a1a2e",
      "surface": "rgba(255,255,255,0.03)",
      "surfaceHover": "rgba(255,255,255,0.045)",
      "border": "rgba(255,255,255,0.06)",
      "accent": "#e94560",
      "accent2": "#0f3460",
      "green": "#4ade80",
      "yellow": "#facc15",
      "red": "#f87171",
      "orange": "#fb923c",
      "purple": "#a78bfa",
      "text": "#e5e5e5",
      "textStrong": "#ffffff",
      "muted": "#737373",
      "dim": "#525252",
      "darker": "#404040",
      "tableBg": "rgba(255,255,255,0.025)",
      "tableHover": "rgba(255,255,255,0.05)",
      "scrollThumb": "rgba(255,255,255,0.1)"
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

```
server.py          ← HTTP server + /api/refresh + /api/chat endpoints
  ├── index.html   ← Single-page dashboard (fetches /api/refresh, /api/chat)
  ├── themes.json  ← Theme definitions (user-editable)
  ├── refresh.sh   ← Data collection script (called by server.py)
  └── data.json    ← Generated data (auto-refreshed)
```

When you open the dashboard, `index.html` calls `/api/refresh`. The server runs `refresh.sh` (with 30s debounce) to collect fresh data from your OpenClaw installation, then returns the JSON. No cron jobs needed.

The `/api/chat` endpoint accepts `{"question": "...", "history": [...]}` and forwards a stateless request to the OpenClaw gateway's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, with a system prompt built from live `data.json`.

## Configuration

Edit `config.json`:

```json
{
  "bot": {
    "name": "My Bot",
    "emoji": "🤖"
  },
  "theme": {
    "preset": "nord"
  },
  "refresh": {
    "intervalSeconds": 30
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 8080,
    "host": "127.0.0.1"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `bot.name` | `"OpenClaw Dashboard"` | Dashboard title |
| `bot.emoji` | `"🦞"` | Avatar emoji |
| `theme.preset` | `"midnight"` | Default theme (`midnight`, `nord`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `github-light`, `solarized-light`, `catppuccin-latte`) |
| `panels.*` | `true` | Show/hide individual panels (`panels.kanban` is legacy/no-op) |
| `refresh.intervalSeconds` | `30` | Debounce interval for refresh |
| `alerts.dailyCostHigh` | `50` | Daily cost threshold for high alert ($) |
| `alerts.dailyCostWarn` | `20` | Daily cost threshold for warning alert ($) |
| `alerts.contextPct` | `80` | Context usage % threshold for alerts |
| `alerts.memoryMb` | `640` | Gateway memory threshold (MB) for alerts |
| `server.port` | `8080` | Server port (also `--port` / `-p` flag or `DASHBOARD_PORT` env) |
| `server.host` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Server bind address (also `--bind` / `-b` flag or `DASHBOARD_BIND` env) |
| `openclawPath` | `"~/.openclaw"` | Legacy key; runtime path is currently controlled by `OPENCLAW_HOME` env var |
| `ai.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable the AI chat panel and `/api/chat` endpoint |
| `ai.gatewayPort` | `18789` | Port of your OpenClaw gateway |
| `ai.model` | `""` | Model to use for chat (any model registered in your gateway) |
| `ai.maxHistory` | `6` | Number of previous messages to include for context |
| `ai.dotenvPath` | `"~/.openclaw/.env"` | Path to `.env` file containing `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` |

### AI Chat Setup

The chat panel requires:

1. Your OpenClaw gateway running with the `chatCompletions` endpoint enabled:
   ```json
   "gateway": {
     "http": { "endpoints": { "chatCompletions": { "enabled": true } } }
   }
   ```
2. `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` set in your `.env` file (defaults to `~/.openclaw/.env`)

The chat is stateless — each question is sent directly to the gateway with a system prompt built from live `data.json`. No agent memory or tools bleed in.

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for full details.

### ⏰ Cron Jobs
All scheduled jobs with status badges (active/idle/error), schedule expression, last run time, next run, duration, and the model used. At-a-glance view of your automation health.

![Cron Jobs](screenshots/03-cron-jobs.png)

---

### 📡 Active Sessions + Agent Hierarchy Tree
Live sessions with model, type badges (DM / group / subagent), context usage %, and token count. Above the session list: a visual agent hierarchy tree showing parent → sub-agent → sub-sub-agent relationships with live/idle status and trigger labels — updated every refresh.

![Active Sessions](screenshots/04-active-sessions.png)

---

### 📊 Token Usage & Cost
Per-model token and cost breakdown with 7d / 30d / all-time tabs. Includes input tokens, output tokens, cache reads, and total cost per model — sortable at a glance.

![Token Usage](screenshots/05-token-usage.png)

---

### 🤖 Sub-Agent Activity
All sub-agent runs with cost, duration, status, and token breakdown. Separate 7d/30d tabs. Useful for tracking which tasks spawn the most agents and where spend is concentrated.

![Sub-Agent Activity](screenshots/06-subagent-activity.png)
